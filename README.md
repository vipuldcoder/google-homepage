#Google Homepage Project

This is the Google Page Replica Project Made by Vipul Aggarwal.This is the first front-end project using of programming languages Html, Css and Javascript.

In this project I have designed a simple web search page that you and other users always see when they visit "http://www.google.com" and do search anything they want to search. But, This is only a design pattern of the Google Homepage. You have only the look and feel of the webpage but you can't use it.

If you have any suggestions or feedback please do mail me "vipulaggarwal099@gmail.com".

For Preview [curriculum]()

Good Luck.
